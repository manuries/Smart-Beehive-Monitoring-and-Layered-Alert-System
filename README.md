# Smart-Beehive-Monitoring-and-Layered-Alert-System

## Arduino Programming
### Robotics Application Development | Sensors + Automation + Control Systems

Developed a robotics‑based beehive monitoring system designed for rural and small‑scale beekeepers.

• Integrated five sensor modules to measure six hive conditions: weight, temperature, humidity, sound, light, and gas concentration. <br>
• Engineered a control box to process sensor data and classify results into a three‑layer alert system (Normal, Warning, Critical). <br>
• Designed a display box with real‑time visualization: sensor values toggle with alert messages, supported by RGB indicators for instant hive status recognition.<br>
• Delivered a standalone, smart system requiring no external connections or devices, ensuring simple and reliable monitoring.
